## Current

I perform as an electronic musician under two identites:

- [Electronic Dog Dream](https://soundcloud.com/robert-snyder-20), as I am most commonly known, 
    with some limited releases also available on [bandcamp](https://electronicdogdream.bandcamp.com/)
- [Komorov](https://komorov.bandcamp.com/), the beast from the east, the mystic sadistic. You can 
    listen also on [Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/artist/2stKwmNA7a1xxOOkTrTPJv) as well 
    as Apple Music, Amazon Prime Music, and most other streaming sources.

There is an older album of mine under my own name as well - [Orchid](https://open.spotify.com/album/6Hbzl2ena3mU5hWACoauBV).

A video of an online performance as Electronic Dog Dream from December of 2020 is on my [Youtube Channel](https://youtu.be/q3RP0LTYQK0).

I also perform as one half of [High Anxiety Cabaret](https://soundcloud.com/user-277778377)
with [Tom Bruce](https://tombrucemusic.space/). 

## Selected Prior Work

For several years, I worked closely with [Todd Broomhead](https://www.facebook.com/todd.broomhead) as 
part of [Broomhead / Snyder](https://www.facebook.com/broomheadsnyder). Our music is available for free
on [archive.org](https://archive.org/search.php?query=creator%3A%22Todd%20Broomhead%22). 

During the mid to late 2000s, I played bass for the all-original poly-rock band 
[Revel at Midnight](https://open.spotify.com/artist/7mofO7Ulh4xz3bmHDVxew6). We released two albums and enjoyed 
some success in the Hudson Valley area for a few years.

I was the drummer for a number of swing and jazz ensembles, much of which lives on only in memory. A notable 
exception is my work with Susie Deane / the Deane Machine on the [Time's a Dancer](https://www.amazon.com/Times-Dancer-Susie-Deane/dp/B01H7Y0AM4)
album. 

## Availability

I am available for both live and session work, as a bassist or synthesist, either in person or online. My schedule is open to one-off or short term engagements; I am 
not currently looking for long term (many months or more) situations. You can contact me at [robscary@gmail.com](mailto:robscary@gmail.com).
