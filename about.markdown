I'm a husband, father, musician, technologist, artist, gamer, and engineer, currently living and working 
in Ithaca, NY, in the heart of the central New York Finger Lakes region. Best way to reach me
is via email at [robscary@gmail.com](mailto:robscary@gmail.com). I look forward to hearing from you.

## Music

I've been fortunate to have a varied and interesting musical career to date. I've played with a number
of small and large orchestras, accompanied jazz ensembles and choirs, played for countless swing dancers,
and been in the pit for numerous operas and musicals. These days, I mostly do electronic music, either
as a solo performer or as one half of [High Anxiety Cabaret](https://soundcloud.com/user-277778377)
with [Tom Bruce](https://tombrucemusic.space/).

My primary instruments are drums / percussion, electric bass, and keyboards / synthesizers of all shape,
size, and color. 

More information about my music, including links to recordings and videos, is on my [music](/music) page.
